# installer

Installation script for Debian 12 (Bookworm).

Copy, modify & use as you please. If you use it, know that there is zero consideration to other users within this script. It is made by, and for me.

For now, this script contains only DWM. I'll probably add more WM/DE's in the future, such as BSPWM.

[Todo]

DWM config incomplete

SXHKD incomplete

Finish install script
